# Recidivism-Forecasting-Challenge
During the Recidivism Forecasting Challenge competition, I achieved the third position by providing an accurate forecast of the likelihood of individuals in the dataset recidivating within one, two, or three years after their release. The competition aimed to improve the prediction of recidivism, which is defined as an arrest for a new crime, using person and place-based inputs through advanced analytics, machine learning, and other sophisticated techniques.
The competition utilized a dataset from the State of Georgia, which included information about individuals released from prison to parole supervision. Participants were encouraged to use this data to develop and test their models, with the goal of improving the accuracy of recidivism predictions. Accurate predictions are crucial in improving public safety and helping individuals reintegrate into society after their release from prison.
The ability to forecast recidivism has significant implications for the criminal justice system, as accurate predictions can help professionals to better allocate resources and design interventions that can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Additionally, individuals at high risk of recidivism can benefit from targeted support and services that can help them successfully transition back into their communities.
Overall, the Recidivism Forecasting Challenge was an important initiative that aimed to leverage data and analytics to reduce recidivism rates and improve outcomes for individuals transitioning out of prison. As a participant in the competition, I contributed to this goal by providing an accurate forecast using pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn to run random forest, and Gradient Boosting using XGBoost, with an ROC score of 0.707.
